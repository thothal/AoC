# Advent of Code
 
## Motivation

Hohoho! A tweet in my timeline called my attention to https://adventofcode.com/ so I
thought I give it a try. Of course in the one and only language there is for *real*
data scientists (sorry you pythonistas): **[R](https://cran.r-project.org/)**.

I will try to create a [R Markdown document](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) for each 
of the assignments where I explain how I came up with the solution (if at all).
